## 🏋️ GYM Project

This is a personal side project where I'm designing and developing a modern GYM landing page.

### 🎯 Goal

My goal is to build a visually appealing and responsive landing page that could be used by a fitness brand or gym. It's a great opportunity to sharpen my frontend skills and explore creative UI design.

### 🌐 Inspiration

I took inspiration from a beautiful concept shared on Dribbble:

- [Dribbble Shot – GYM Landing Page Design](https://dribbble.com/shots/24338208-GYM-Landing-Page-Design)

Here’s a preview of the design I’m working from:

### 🛠️ Tech Stack (Planned)

- Next.js
- Tailwind CSS or CSS Modules
- Framer Motion (for animations)
- MDX for content (like this!)

I'm excited to see how this turns out and will be sharing progress updates soon!
